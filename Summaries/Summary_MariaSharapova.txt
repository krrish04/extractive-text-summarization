Summary: 
I think everyone just thinks because we're tennis players we should be the greatest of friends. I think just because you're in the same sport doesn't mean that you have to be friends with everyone just because you're categorized, you're a tennis player, so you're going to get along with tennis players. Uhm, I'm not really friendly or close to many players. Maria Sharapova has basically no friends as tennis players on the WTA Tour. I say my hellos, but I'm not sending any players flowers as well
